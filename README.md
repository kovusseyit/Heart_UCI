# Heart_UCI
Heart disease prediction using UCI data from Kaggle

## Heart UCI EDA and ML Modeling

In this project I do data exploration and visualization of Heart UCI dataset from Kaggle. Additionally, I use various classification algorithms to try and predict patients with heart condition.

This implementation is completely done using Numpy, Pandas, Yellowbrick which are open-sourced numerical computing, data manipulation and visualization libraries respectively.

Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).

See if you can find any other trends in heart data to predict certain cardiovascular events or find any clear indications of heart health.
