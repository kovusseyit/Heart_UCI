# Heart_UCI
Heart disease UCI project

## Heart UCI EDA and ML Modeling

In this project I do data exploration and visualization of Heart UCI dataset from Kaggle. Additionally, I use various classification algorithms to try and predict patients with heart condition.

This implementation is completely done using Numpy, Pandas, Yellowbrick which are open-sourced numerical computing, data manipulation and visualization libraries respectively.

## Prerequisites(to be edited)

    Numpy == 1.17.3
    SciPy == 1.3.1
    Matplotlib == 3.1.2 # For Visualization

(This code base was developed on Python3.7.4)
## Code(to be edited)

''pip install -r requirements.txt

For classification example run the following command:

''python3 classification_example.py

For regression example run the following command:

''python3 regression_example.py
