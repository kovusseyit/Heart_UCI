Heart disease UCI project

## Heart UCI EDA and ML Modeling

In this project I do data exploration and visualization of Heart UCI dataset from Kaggle. Additionally, I use various classification algorithms to try and predict patients with heart condition.

This implementation is completely done using Numpy, Pandas, Yellowbrick which are open-sourced numerical computing, data manipulation and visualization libraries respectively.

## Prerequisites(to be edited)

    Numpy == 1.17.3
    SciPy == 1.3.1
    Matplotlib == 3.1.2 # For Visualization

(This code base was developed on Python3.7.4)
## Code(to be edited)

''pip install -r requirements.txt

For classification example run the following command:

''python3 classification_example.py

For regression example run the following command:

''python3 regression_example.py

Inspiration

Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).

See if you can find any other trends in heart data to predict certain cardiovascular events or find any clear indications of heart health.
